Daniel Kahneman is an Israeli-American psychologist and economist known for his work on hedonic psychology, psychology of judgment and decision-making, and behavioral economics. He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (shared with Vernon L. Smith). His empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory.

Here is some of his notable work:

* **Prospect Theory (1979)**: Kahneman and Amos Tversky developed prospect theory, which challenges the prevailing assumption in economics that people make decisions rationally based on expected utility. Prospect theory suggests that people are more risk-averse when making gains and more risk-seeking when making losses, a phenomenon known as loss aversion.

* **Hedonic Adaptation (1990)**: Kahneman and his colleagues found that people tend to adapt to their circumstances, even if those circumstances change significantly. This means that people's happiness is not determined solely by their objective circumstances, but also by their expectations and their ability to adjust to change.

* **Anchoring Bias (1974)**: Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated that people are susceptible to anchoring bias, which means that they are influenced by the first piece of information they receive when making a decision. This can lead to irrational decisions, as people may place too much weight on the anchor and fail to consider other relevant information.

* **Availability Bias (1974)**: Kahneman and Tversky also identified availability bias, which means that people are more likely to overestimate the likelihood of events that are more easily remembered. This can lead to irrational decision-making, as people may be more likely to avoid risks that they have heard about recently, even if those risks are actually very low.

Kahneman's work has had a profound impact on economics, psychology, and other fields. His insights have helped to explain why people make irrational decisions, and they have led to the development of new tools and strategies for making better decisions. Kahneman's work is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how the human mind works and how to make better decisions in their own lives.

Here are some of his most notable books:

- [[Thinking Fast and Slow]] (2011)
Kahneman's most famous book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, outlines his dual-process theory of the mind. This theory suggests that the mind has two systems for making decisions: System 1, which is fast, intuitive, and emotional, and System 2, which is slow, deliberate, and rational. Kahneman argues that System 1 often dominates our decision-making, leading to irrationality and bias.

* **Maps of Bounded Rationality (1994)**: This book, co-authored with Amos Tversky, explores the limitations of human rationality. Kahneman and Tversky argue that people are not as rational as economists often assume, and that their decision-making is often affected by biases and heuristics.

* **Anomalies of Decision Making (2000)**: This book, co-edited by Kahneman with Paul Slovic and Amos Tversky, collects a series of essays on the various biases and heuristics that affect human decision-making. The essays explore topics such as the endowment effect, the sunk cost fallacy, and the framing effect.

Daniel Kahneman is a pioneering figure in the field of behavioral economics and has made significant contributions to our understanding of human cognition. His work has helped to debunk the myth of human rationality and has provided valuable insights into the factors that influence our decision-making. Kahneman's legacy is one of intellectual rigor, originality, and profound impact.
