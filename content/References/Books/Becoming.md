description: >-
  In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged
  as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of
  the United States of America—the first African American to serve in that
  role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in
  history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and
  girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that
  families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband
  as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way,
  she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two
  down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.  
    
  In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling,
  Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences
  that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her
  years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her
  time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and
  lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public
  and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and
  on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal
  reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied
  expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.
