description: >-
  Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult
  issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability,
  efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety
  of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch
  processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your
  application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords?  
    
    
  In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you
  navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various
  technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the
  fundamental principles remain the same. With this book, software engineers and
  architects will learn how to apply those ideas in practice, and how to make
  full use of data in modern applications.  
    
    
  Peer under the hood of the systems you already use, and learn how to use and
  operate them more effectively  

  Make informed decisions by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of
  different tools  

  Navigate the trade-offs around consistency, scalability, fault tolerance, and
  complexity  

  Understand the distributed systems research upon which modern databases are
  built  

  Peek behind the scenes of major online services, and learn from their
  architectures
