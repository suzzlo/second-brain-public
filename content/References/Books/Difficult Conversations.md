description: |-
  Whether you're dealing with an under performing employee, disagreeing with your spouse about money or child-rearing, negotiating with a difficult client, or simply saying "no," or "I'm sorry," or "I love you," we attempt or avoid difficult conversation every day. Based on fifteen years of research at the Harvard Negotiation Project, _Difficult Conversations_ walks you through a step-by-step proven approach to having your toughest conversations with less stress and more success.  
    
  You will learn:  
  \-- how to start the conversation without defensiveness  
  \-- why what is not said is as important as what is  
  \-- ways of keeping and regaining your balance in the face of attacks and accusations  
  \-- how to decipher the underlying structure of every difficult conversation  
    
  Filled with examples from everyday life, _Difficult Conversations_ will help you on your job, at home, or out of the world. It is a book you will turn to again and again for advice, practical skills, and reassurance.
