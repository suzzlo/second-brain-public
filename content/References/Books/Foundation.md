  **The first novel in Isaac Asimov's classic science-fiction masterpiece, the
  Foundation series**  
    
  For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is
  dying. But only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of
  psychohistory, can see into the future--to a dark age of ignorance, barbarism,
  and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and
  save humankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists
  and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to
  serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls his sanctuary the
  Foundation.
