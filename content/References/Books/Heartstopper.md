  **Boy meets boy. Boys become friends. Boys fall in love. The bestselling
  LGBTQ+ graphic novel about life, love, and everything that happens in between:
  this is the fourth volume of HEARTSTOPPER, for fans of _The Art of Being
  Normal_, Holly Bourne and _Love, Simon_.**  
    
  Charlie didn't think Nick could ever like him back, but now they're officially
  boyfriends. Charlie's beginning to feel ready to say those three little words:
  _I love you_.  
    
  Nick's been feeling the same, but he's got a lot on his mind - not least
  coming out to his dad, and the fact that Charlie might have an eating
  disorder.  
    
  As summer turns to autumn and a new school year begins, Charlie and Nick are
  about to learn a lot about what love means.  
    
  _Heartstopper_ is about love, friendship, loyalty and mental illness. It
  encompasses all the small stories of Nick and Charlie's lives that together
  make up something larger, which speaks to all of us.  
    
  This is the fourth volume of _Heartstopper_, which has now been optioned for
  television by See-Saw Films.
