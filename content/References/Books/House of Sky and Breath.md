description: >-
  Bryce Quinlan and Hunt Athalar are trying to get back to normal―they may have
  saved Crescent City, but with so much upheaval in their lives lately, they
  mostly want a chance to relax. Slow down. Figure out what the future holds.  
    
  The Asteri have kept their word so far, leaving Bryce and Hunt alone. But with
  the rebels chipping away at the Asteri’s power, the threat the rulers pose is
  growing. As Bryce, Hunt, and their friends get pulled into the rebels’ plans,
  the choice becomes clear: stay silent while others are oppressed, or fight for
  what’s right. And they’ve never been very good at staying silent.  
    
  In this sexy, action-packed sequel to the #1 bestseller House of Earth and
  Blood, Sarah J. Maas weaves a captivating story of a world about to
  explode―and the people who will do anything to save it.
