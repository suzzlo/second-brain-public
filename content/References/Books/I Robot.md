  Isaac Asimov's I, Robot launches readers on an adventure into a not-so-distant
  future where man and machine , struggle to redefinelife, love, and
  consciousness—and where the stakes are nothing less than survival. Filled with
  unforgettable characters, mind-bending speculation, and nonstop action, I,
  Robot is a powerful reading experience from one of the master storytellers of
  our time.  
    
  I, ROBOT  
    
  They mustn't harm a human being, they must obey human orders, and they must
  protect their own existence...but only so long as that doesn't violate rules
  one and two. With these Three Laws of Robotics, humanity embarked on perhaps
  its greatest adventure: the invention of the first positronic man. It was a
  bold new era of evolution that would open up enormous possibilities—and
  unforeseen risks. For the scientists who invented the earliest robots weren't
  content that their creations should ' remain programmed helpers, companions,
  and semisentient worker-machines. And soon the robots themselves; aware of
  their own intelligence, power, and humanity, aren't either.  
    
  As humans and robots struggle to survive together—and sometimes against each
  other—on earth and in space, the future of both hangs in the balance. Human
  men and women confront robots gone mad, telepathic robots, robot politicians,
  and vast robotic intelligences that may already secretly control the world.
  And both are asking the same questions: What is human? And is humanity
  obsolete?  
    
  In l, Robot Isaac Asimov changes forever our perception of robots, and human
  beings and updates the timeless myth of man's dream to play god. with all its
  rewards—and terrors.
