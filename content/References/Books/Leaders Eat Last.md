  **Why do only a few people get to say “I love my job”? It seems unfair that
  finding fulfillment at work is like winning a lottery; that only a few lucky
  ones get to feel valued by their organizations, to feel like they belong.**  
    
  Imagine a world where almost everyone wakes up inspired to go to work, feels
  trusted and valued during the day, then returns home feeling fulfilled.  
    
  This is not a crazy, idealized notion. Today, in many successful
  organizations, great leaders are creating environments in which people
  naturally work together to do remarkable things.  
    
  In his travels around the world since the publication of his bestseller _Start
  with Why_, Simon Sinek noticed that some teams were able to trust each other
  so deeply that they would literally put their lives on the line for each
  other. Other teams, no matter what incentives were offered, were doomed to
  infighting, fragmentation and failure. Why?  
    
  The answer became clear during a conversation with a Marine Corps general.  
    
  “Officers eat last,” he said.  
    
  Sinek watched as the most junior Marines ate first while the most senior
  Marines took their place at the back of the line. What’s symbolic in the chow
  hall is deadly serious on the battlefield: great leaders sacrifice their own
  comfort—even their own survival—for the good of those in their care.  
    
  This principle has been true since the earliest tribes of hunters and
  gatherers. It’s not a management theory; it’s biology. Our brains and bodies
  evolved to help us find food, shelter, mates and especially safety. We’ve
  always lived in a dangerous world, facing predators and enemies at every turn.
  We thrived only when we felt safe among our group.  
    
    
  Our biology hasn’t changed in fifty thousand years, but our environment
  certainly has. Today’s workplaces tend to be full of cynicism, paranoia and
  self-interest. But the best organizations foster trust and cooperation because
  their leaders build what Sinek calls a Circle of Safety that separates the
  security inside the team from the challenges outside.  
    
  The Circle of Safety leads to stable, adaptive, confident teams, where
  everyone feels they belong and all energies are devoted to facing the common
  enemy and seizing big opportunities.  
    
  As he did in _Start with Why_, Sinek illustrates his ideas with fascinating
  true stories from a wide range of examples, from the military to
  manufacturing, from government to investment banking.  
    
  The biology is clear: when it matters most, leaders who are willing to eat
  last are rewarded with deeply loyal colleagues who will stop at nothing to  

  advance their leader’s vision and their organization’s interests. It’s amazing
  how well it works.
