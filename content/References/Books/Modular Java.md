description: >-
  Attack complexity in your Java applications using Modular Java . This
  pragmatic guide introduces you to OSGi and Spring Dynamic Modules, two of the
  most compelling frameworks for Java modularization. Driven by real-world
  examples, this book will equip you with the know-how you need to develop Java
  applications that are composed of smaller, loosely coupled, highly cohesive
  modules.  
    
  The secret weapon for attacking complexity in any project is to break it down
  into smaller, cohesive, and more easily digestible pieces. With Modular Java ,
  you can easily develop applications that are more flexible, testable,
  maintainable, and comprehensible.  
    
  Modular Java is a pragmatic guide to developing modular applications using
  OSGi, the framework for dynamic modularity in Java, and Spring Dynamic
  Modules, an OSGi extension to the Spring Framework. You'll start with the
  basics but quickly ramp up, creating loosely coupled modules that publish and
  consume services, and you'll see how to compose them into larger applications.
  Along the way, you'll apply what you learn as you build a complete web
  application that is made up of several OSGi modules, using Spring-DM to wire
  those modules together.  
    
  Modular Java is filled with tips and tricks that will make you a more
  proficient OSGi and Spring-DM developer. Equipped with the know-how gained
  from this book, you'll be able to develop applications that are more robust
  and agile.
