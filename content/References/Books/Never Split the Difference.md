  **A former FBI hostage negotiator offers a new, field-tested approach to
  negotiating – effective in any situation.**  
    
  After a stint policing the rough streets of Kansas City, Missouri, Chris Voss
  joined the FBI, where his career as a kidnapping negotiator brought him
  face-to-face with bank robbers, gang leaders and terrorists. _Never Split the
  Difference_ takes you inside his world of high-stakes negotiations, revealing
  the nine key principles that helped Voss and his colleagues succeed when it
  mattered the most – when people’s lives were at stake.  
    
  Rooted in the real-life experiences of an intelligence professional at the top
  of his game, _Never Split the Difference_ will give you the competitive edge
  in any discussion.
