  Exiled to the Shadows for centuries, a man more than mortal awakens in an
  Earth hospital with no memory of his past—and is surrounded by enemies who
  hunger for his destruction. For Corwin is of The blood—the rightful successor
  to the throne of the real world. But to rule, he must conquer impossible
  realities & demonic assassins... and survive the ruthless machinations of the
  most insidious malevolence imaginable: his own family.
