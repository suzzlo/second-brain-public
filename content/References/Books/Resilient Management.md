  Finding your bearings as a manager can feel overwhelming—but you don’t have to
  fake it to make it, and you don’t have to go it alone. Lara Hogan shares her
  recipe for supporting and leading a tech team—from developing your mentoring
  and coaching skills, to getting comfortable with having difficult
  conversations, to boosting trust among teammates—while staying grounded along
  the way.
