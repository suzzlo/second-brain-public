description: |-
  In his _New York Times_ bestseller _Steal Like an Artist_, Austin Kleon showed readers how to unlock their creativity by “stealing” from the community of other movers and shakers. Now, in an even more forward-thinking and necessary book, he shows how to take that critical next step on a creative journey—getting known.  
    
  _Show Your Work!_ is about why generosity trumps genius. It’s about getting _findable_, about using the network instead of wasting time “networking.” It’s not self-promotion, it’s self-discovery—let others into your process, then let them steal from you. Filled with illustrations, quotes, stories, and examples, _Show Your Work!_ offers ten transformative rules for being open, generous, brave, productive.  
    
  In chapters such as **You Don’t Have to Be a Genius**; **Share Something Small Every Day**; and **Stick Around**, Kleon creates a user’s manual for embracing the communal nature of creativity— what he calls the “ecology of talent.” From broader life lessons about work (you can’t find your voice if you don’t use it) to the etiquette of sharing—and the dangers of oversharing—to the practicalities of Internet life (build a good domain name; give credit when credit is due), it’s an inspiring manifesto for succeeding as any kind of artist or entrepreneur in the digital age.
