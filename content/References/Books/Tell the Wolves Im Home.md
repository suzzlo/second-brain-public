  In this striking literary debut, Carol Rifka Brunt unfolds a moving story of
  love, grief, and renewal as two lonely people become the unlikeliest of
  friends and find that sometimes you don't know you've lost someone until
  you've found them.  
    
  1987\. There's only one person who has ever truly understood fourteen-year-old
  June Elbus, and that's her uncle, the renowned painter Finn Weiss. Shy at
  school and distant from her older sister, June can only be herself in Finn's
  company; he is her godfather, confidant, and best friend. So when he dies, far
  too young, of a mysterious illness her mother can barely speak about, June's
  world is turned upside down. But Finn's death brings a surprise acquaintance
  into June's lifeâ€”someone who will help her to heal, and to question what she
  thinks she knows about Finn, her family, and even her own heart.  
    
  At Finn's funeral, June notices a strange man lingering just beyond the crowd.
  A few days later, she receives a package in the mail. Inside is a beautiful
  teapot she recognizes from Finn's apartment, and a note from Toby, the
  stranger, asking for an opportunity to meet. As the two begin to spend time
  together, June realizes she's not the only one who misses Finn, and if she can
  bring herself to trust this unexpected friend, he just might be the one she
  needs the most.  
    
  An emotionally charged coming-of-age novel, _Tell the Wolves I'm Home_ is a
  tender story of love lost and found, an unforgettable portrait of the way
  compassion can make us whole again.
