description: >-
  Getting rich is not just about luck; Happiness is not just a trait we are born
  with. These aspirations may seem out of reach, but building wealth and being
  happy are skills we can learn. So what are these skills, and how do we learn
  them? What are the principles that should guide our efforts? What does
  progress really look like? Naval Ravikant is an entrepreneur, philosopher, and
  investor who has captivated the world with his principles for building wealth
  and creating long-term happiness. The Almanack of Naval Ravikant is a
  collection of Naval’s wisdom and experience from the last ten years, shared as
  a curation of his most insightful interviews and poignant reflections. This
  isn’t a how-to book, or a step-by-step gimmick. Instead, through Naval’s own
  words, you will learn how to walk your own unique path toward a happier,
  wealthier life.
