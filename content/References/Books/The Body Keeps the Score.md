  **A pioneering researcher transforms our understanding of trauma and offers a
  bold new paradigm for healing.**  
    
  Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful
  aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew
  up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence.
  Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world's foremost experts on trauma, has
  spent over three decades working with survivors. In _The Body Keeps the
  Score_, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally
  reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers' capacities for pleasure,
  engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments—from
  neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths
  to recovery by activating the brain's natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr.
  van der Kolk's own research and that of other leading specialists, _The Body
  Keeps the Score_ exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to
  hurt and to heal—and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.
