  **An international business expert helps you understand and navigate cultural
  differences in this insightful and practical guide, perfect for both your work
  and personal life.** Americans precede anything negative with three nice
  comments; French, Dutch, Israelis, and Germans get straight to the point;
  Latin Americans and Asians are steeped in hierarchy; Scandinavians think the
  best boss is just one of the crowd. It's no surprise that when they try and
  talk to each other, chaos breaks out. In The Culture Map, INSEAD professor
  Erin Meyer is your guide through this subtle, sometimes treacherous terrain in
  which people from starkly different backgrounds are expected to work
  harmoniously together. She provides a field-tested model for decoding how
  cultural differences impact international business, and combines a smart
  analytical framework with practical, actionable advice.
