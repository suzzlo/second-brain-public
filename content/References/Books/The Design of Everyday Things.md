description: >-
  Anyone who designs anything to be used by humans -- from physical objects to
  computer programs to conceptual tools -- must read this book, and it is an
  equally tremendous read for anyone who has to use anything created by another
  human. It could forever change how you experience and interact with your
  physical surroundings, open your eyes to the perversity of bad design and the
  desirability of good design, and raise your expectations about how things
  _should_ be designed.
