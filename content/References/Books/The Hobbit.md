description: >-
  In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,
  filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy
  hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and
  that means comfort.  

  Written for J.R.R. Tolkienâ€™s own children, The Hobbit met with instant
  critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a
  timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard
  Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the
  adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel
  dragon Smaug the Magnificent. The text in this 372-page paperback edition is
  based on that first published in Great Britain by Collins Modern Classics
  (1998), and includes a note on the text by Douglas A. Anderson (2001).
