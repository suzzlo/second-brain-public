  **One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all
  and in the darkness bind them**  
    
  In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and
  Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so
  that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though
  he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages
  it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.  
    
  From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and
  wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for
  the One Ring that would complete his dominion.  
    
  When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to
  his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across
  Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by
  casting it into the Cracks of Doom.  
    
  _The Lord of the Rings_ tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the
  Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and
  Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall,
  mysterious stranger called Strider.
