description: >-
  From the books of H.G. Wells to the press releases of NASA, we are awash in
  clich√©d claims about high technology's ability to change the course of
  history. Now, in The Shock of the Old , David Edgerton offers a startling new
  and fresh way of thinking about the history of technology, radically revising
  our ideas about the interaction of technology and society in the past and in
  the present. He challenges us to view the history of technology in terms of
  what everyday people have actually used-and continue to use-rather than just
  sophisticated inventions. Indeed, many highly touted technologies, from the
  V-2 rocket to the Concorde jet, have been costly failures, while many mundane
  discoveries, like corrugated iron, become hugely important around the world.
  Edgerton reassesses the significance of such acclaimed inventions as the Pill
  and information technology, and underscores the continued importance of
  unheralded technology, debunking many notions about the implications of the  

  "information age." A provocative history, The Shock of the Old provides an
  entirely new way of looking historically at the relationship between invention
  and innovation.
