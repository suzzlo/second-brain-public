  On a warm July evening in 1985, a middle-aged man stood on the pavement of a
  busy avenue in the heart of Moscow, holding a plastic carrier bag. In his grey
  suit and tie, he looked like any other Soviet citizen. The bag alone was
  mildly conspicuous, printed with the red logo of Safeway, the British
  supermarket.  
    
  The man was a spy for MI6. A senior KGB officer, for more than a decade he had
  supplied his British spymasters with a stream of priceless secrets from deep
  within the Soviet intelligence machine. No spy had done more to damage the
  KGB. The Safeway bag was a signal: to activate his escape plan to be smuggled
  out of Soviet Russia.  
    
  So began one of the boldest and most extraordinary episodes in the history of
  spying. Ben Macintyre reveals a tale of espionage, betrayal and raw courage
  that changed the course of the Cold War forever...
