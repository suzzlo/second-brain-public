  This is society.

  Now let’s zoom in on the left arm.

  Further.

  Okay see those skin flaps on the elbow? Let’s zoom in on the bottom one.

  Little more.

  There! See me? Come closer.

  Hi. I’m Tim. I’m a single cell in society’s body. U.S. society, to be specific.  
    
  So let me explain why we’re here.  
    
  As a writer and a generally thinky person, I’ve spent a lot of my life thinking about the society I live in, and societies in general. I’ve always imagined society as a kind of giant human—a living organism like each of us, only much bigger.  
    
  When you’re a single cell in the body of a giant, it’s hard to understand what the giant’s doing, or why it is the way it is, because you can’t really zoom out and look at the whole thing all at once. But we do our best.  
    
  The thing is, when I’ve recently tried to imagine what society might look like, I haven’t really been picturing this:  
    
  Giant stick figure: "I am grown up."  
    
  Based on what I see around me, in person and online, it seems like my society is actually more like this:  
    
  Giant stick figure throwing a giant tantrum because their chocolate ice cream fell on the ground.  
    
  Individual humans grow older as they age—but it kind of seems like the giant human I live in has been getting more childish each year that goes by.  
    
  So I decided to write a blog post about this. But then something else happened.  
    
  When I told people I was planning to write a post about society, and the way people are acting, and the way the media is acting, and the way the government is acting, and the way everyone else is acting, people kept saying the same thing to me.  
    
  Don’t do it. Don’t touch it. Write about something else. Anything else. It’s just not worth it.  
    
  They were right. With so many non-controversial topics to write about, why take on something so loaded and risk alienating a ton of readers? I listened to people’s warnings, and I thought about moving on to something else, but then I was like, “Wait what? I live inside a giant and the giant is having a six-year-old meltdown in the grocery store candy section and that’s a not-okay thing for me to talk about?”  
    
  It hit me that what I really needed to write about was that—about why it’s perilous to write about society."
