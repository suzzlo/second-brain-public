description: >-
  In _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ Patrick Lencioni once again offers a
  leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two
  best-selling books, _The Five Temptations of a CEO_ and _The Four Obsessions
  of an Extraordinary Executive_. This time, he turns his keen intellect and
  storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams.  
    
  Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis:
  Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire
  company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail?
  Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership
  requires as much courage as it does insight.  
    
  Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the
  very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a
  powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common
  hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books,
  Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple
  message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.
