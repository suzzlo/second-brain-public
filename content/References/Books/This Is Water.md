description: >-
  Only once did David Foster Wallace give a public talk on his views on life,
  during a commencement address given in 2005 at Kenyon College. The speech is
  reprinted for the first time in book form in THIS IS WATER.  
    
  How does one keep from going through their comfortable, prosperous adult life
  unconsciously? How do we get ourselves out of the foreground of our thoughts
  and achieve compassion? The speech captures Wallace's electric intellect as
  well as his grace in attention to others. After his death, it became a
  treasured piece of writing reprinted in _The Wall Street Journal_ and the
  _London Times_, commented on endlessly in blogs, and emailed from friend to
  friend.  
    
  Writing with his one-of-a-kind blend of causal humor, exacting intellect, and
  practical philosophy, David Foster Wallace probes the challenges of daily
  living and offers advice that renews us with every reading.
