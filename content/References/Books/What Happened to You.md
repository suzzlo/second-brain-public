description: >-
  **Our earliest experiences shape our lives far down the road, and _What
  Happened to You?_ provides powerful scientific and emotional insights into the
  behavioral patterns so many of us struggle to understand.**  
    
  _“Through this lens we can build a renewed sense of personal self-worth and
  ultimately recalibrate our responses to circumstances, situations, and
  relationships. It is, in other words, the key to reshaping our very
  lives.”_—Oprah Winfrey  
    
  **This book is going to change the way you see your life.**  
    
  Have you ever wondered "Why did I do that?" or "Why can't I just control my
  behavior?" Others may judge our reactions and think, "What's wrong with that
  person?" When questioning our emotions, it's easy to place the blame on
  ourselves; holding ourselves and those around us to an impossible standard.
  It's time we started asking a different question.  
    
  Through deeply personal conversations, Oprah Winfrey and renowned brain and
  trauma expert Dr. Bruce Perry offer a groundbreaking and profound shift from
  asking “What’s wrong with you?” to “What happened to you?”  
    
  Here, Winfrey shares stories from her own past, understanding through
  experience the vulnerability that comes from facing trauma and adversity at a
  young age. In conversation throughout the book, she and Dr. Perry focus on
  understanding people, behavior, and ourselves. It’s a subtle but profound
  shift in our approach to trauma, and it’s one that allows us to understand our
  pasts in order to clear a path to our future—opening the door to resilience
  and healing in a proven, powerful way.
